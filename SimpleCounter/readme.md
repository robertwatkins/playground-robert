# Introduction
This is a simple example of using Behavior-Driven Development practices to write tests. 

# Getting Set Up
The only 3rd-party library is 'jbehave' which provides the toolset for implementing the test. If you have a Java IDE and 
maven set up, you are ready to go. If not, I would like to suggest using 
 - The latest version of the [Java JDK](https://java.com/en/download/)
 - The [Community Edition of IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
 - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) if you choose to not use IntelliJ
 
 Once you have your tools in place, download or clone [this project](https://github.com/robertwatkins/playground-robert) 
 
 # Running the code
  - Run the 'SimpleCounterRunner.java' file.
