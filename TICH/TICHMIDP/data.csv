This was followed by the  8086 processors which were 16-bit processors and was used in the original IBM PC. This break from a number scheme to describe the chip was based on lawsuits that prohibited trademarking numbers for product names. These chips build on the instruction set from the original 8086 chipset."

Over time, the feedback received may result in a new RFC being added that supercedes the previous version. Even with these documents, there is often enough 'wiggle room' of interpretation where various implementations are incompatible and other means are used to create a more formal standard. However, these documents are often considered to reflect the spirit of the protocol, if not the complete set of guidelines."

The 8080 processor follows 4004 and 8008 processors, which are arguably the first microprocessors."
June,19,2000,Windows ME is released to computer manufacturers,"Largely viewed as a disaster in marketing and engineering, this operating system was a minor update to Windows 98 and was seen as the consumer alternative to the business-focused Windows 2000 operating system. It was intended to be seen as 'new', when in reality, it included mostly some new applications. While not as bad as the Microsoft Bob system, this comes in a close second."
June,20,1950,The (US) National Bureau of Standards dedicates the SEAC,"The SEAC (Standards Eastern Automatic Computer) used the more reliable diode instead of the vacuum tube. This was also the United State's first stored-program computer, meaning that you didn't need to hard-wire the program to be able to run it, you could load the program into memory and run it."

This demo shows the work that he's been engaged in for the last eight years making computers easier to use."
June,21,1948,The first stored computer program is run,"Before this time, programs were hard-wired into the computer. Changing the program meant changing literally changing wires. At this time in Britain, that changed with the ability to store the program inside the computer to be modified or changed much easier."
June,22,1979,InfoCom is incorporated,"Bringing us such interactive fiction games as Zork and Planetfall, Infocom was incorporated by a group from MIT. The MIT team was from the Dynamic Modeling Group, who must have decided that developing systems for Artificial Intelligence research was not as fun as making games. The interactive fiction type of game allows the user to type in commands in a surprisingly free-form manner to navigate through the game. In turn, the game would respond with a textual description of the result. For example, you could type 'Open the mailbox', to which the computer would respond 'Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet'."
June,23,1902,Howard Engstrom is born,"Howard Engstrom joined the Navy's CSAW (Communications Supplementary Activities - Washington) to work on cryptography and was encouraged to start a private company to do this research.

June,29,1992,Silicon Graphics and MIPS merge,"In the 1980s, Silicon Graphics was the primary producer of computer systems needing graphics capabilities. With the advent of Personal Computers, the need for a specialized computer was declining. Buying the company, MIPS, that made the processor for their systems seemed like a good move, but it was essentially the beginning of the end. RISC processors in general became less popular and the company is now gone."
June,30,2008,The last day for PC makers to install Windows XP by default,"Windows XP has been out since 2001 and consumers were looking for a safe and useful alternative to Windows 98 and Windows ME. Windows XP turned out to be too much of a good thing. When Windows Vista was released, very few wanted to change from a system that was generally useful and stable. In a move to force users to upgrade to the next operating system, this end-of-life date was meant to kill the demand at the source and force new users to the newest version of Windows."
July,1,1984,Neuromancer is released,"Although William Gibson uses the term 'cyberspace' in an earlier short story, this is its first use in a book.  This is six years before the invention of the World Wide Web.

This prompted several BO2K detection tools to be released such as BoDetect."
July,11,1994,Gary Kildall dies,"While computer pioneers are not well known to participate in bar brawls, let alone die in one, this is what happened to Gary Kildall. Of his many achievements, he is known for the CP/M operating system which the Microsoft DOS is heavily influenced by."

August,1,1967,Grace Hopper recalled to active duty at the age of 70,"Her abilities were not in fighting, but in developing compilers. In this case, she was being asked to coordinate the standardization of COBOL. As early as 1952, she began work on translating english text to programs, which was not accepted at the time as a proper way to program computers. Her early compilers were improved over the years and various flavors were in general use. The US military was keen on having a standard and relatively simple way to program computers. Her experience made her the best choice to finish this effort."
August,2,1993,The Apple Newton is launched,"The Apple Newton was the first device to refer to itself as a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). Arguably, the Psion, which was released nine years earlier, was a PDA, but that term was coined to specifically describe the Apple Newton. This device used a pen to accept handwriting input for taking notes, adding appointments and performing other tasks. However, not all the technology worked as well as it had been advertised. In fact, one Simpson's episode had the bully Nelson's to-do entry 'Beat up Martin' get interpreted as 'Eat up Martha'. "
August,3,1977,Radio Shack first introduces the TRS-80 line of computers,"This personal computer was introduced four years before the IBM-PC was announced.

August,5,1968,First public demo of packet switching,"The National Physical Labratory demonstrated packet switching for the first time. This revolution in network traffic handling allowed for the Internet to be as widely used as it is today by breaking down the data being sent between computers into small chunks that are re-assembled by the receiving computer. Before this, the network would allow only a certain number of connections to exist at a time on a network, leaving some computers to be unable to send/receive data for an unacceptable amount of time. With packet switching, all connections are honored, but the data is received more slowly."
August,5,1989,Internet Multicasting RFC is submitted,"RFC 1112 for Internet Multicasting was submitted. This idea was developed as a thesis project a year earlier based around finding and automatically configuring services on a network. Reading through this RFC you would find no mention of automatic configuration of services, but that suggestion led to this suggestion. Supporting the ideas in RFC 1112 was intended to allow for multiple systems to receive data from a server without the typical overhead of maintaining a connection between each system."
August,5,1989,The Video Toaster is on display at SiGGRAPH,"SIGGRAPH is the premiere conference on computer graphics tools and techniques. The Video Toaster was one of the first professional-quality add-ons for a personal computer that could effectively produce video.

August,13,1999,The Matrix is released,"This movie features a world where aliens have taken over the Earth and have enslaved the humans by implanting an interface that makes them believe they are living in a seemingly normal world as it existed prior to the alien's arrival. However, there are a few humans that are able to overcome this illusion and see the simulation for what it is."
August,14,1984,The EGA computer graphics standard is announced,This was the first personal computer color video standard to have a higher resolution than broadcast television. It came at a cost though. A $200 memory upgrade was required and then the card itself was over $500.
