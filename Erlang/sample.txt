Let's take a test-driven development approach and see how this turns out.

Forgetting the implementation, is this what we want?

>tissue:init().                                              %%perform any initialization
ok
>tissue:split(Cell1).                                   %%Cell 1 splits, the output describes the new cell
Cell2
>tissue:split(Cell1).                                   %%Cell 1 splits again
Cell3
>tissue:split(Cell1).                                   %%at some point, we can't split any more
{error, unable}
>tissue:turn_cancerous(Cell1).              %%a cell can 'spontaneously' become cancerous
ok
>tissue:turn_cancerous(Cell1).              %%a cell may be re-triggered to be cancerous
ok
>tissue:turn_cancerous(Cell1,Cell2).  %%Cell1 can cause Cell2 to be cancerous
ok
>tissue:split(Cell2).                                  %% Cell2 can split to create another cancer cell
Cell4
>tissue:map();

blank = no cell
x = cancer
0 = healthy
