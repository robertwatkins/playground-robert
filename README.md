Code projects that seem important enough to keep

**cellgroup**
This was some code used in for a submission to the a Functional Programming Conference. It was simulating a cell matrix in Erlang.

**Erlang**
Basic notes on learning Erlang.

**genetic**
An experiment in writing a genetic algorithm to [simulate the 'sine' function using a polynomial equation](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102247002918593029402/posts/DmRRRkDeGrg?pid=6007141866236681474&oid=102247002918593029402). It was written in TCL and used ImageMagik to create an animated gif of the results.

**graphml**
Sample code for importing, manipulating and exporting graphml

**ouCapstone**
Sample code and documents for presentations given to the OU CS Capsone class

**plugin**
The beginnings of a 'secure note' plugin. The initial version is for Chrome, though not functional at this point.

**reference**
Using a tool to build a Rest API in node.js for a future project.

**SecureLogin**
Demo implementation of secure login. Everything is in memory, no db. This is focused on getting the sequence of steps right using appropriate algorithms

**Sikuli**
Samples for running Sikuli on Linux with Firefox.

**SimpleCounter**
This has two purposes. (1) Provide a simple BDD (Behavior Driven Development) sample using JBehave and (2) Provide as a base for providing applicants a method of sending in a simple work sample where they are asked to fix an issue with this sample and submit an improvement.

**TICH**
[Today in Computing History](https://sites.google.com/site/todayincomputinghistory/) is a project that was inpsired by some of my writings on the history of computing. This folder contains mutliple projects for varvariations on the idea of having an electronic 'day at a time' calendar.

**Python**
Scratchpad folder for sample code to be used in other projects. Mostly under construction.
